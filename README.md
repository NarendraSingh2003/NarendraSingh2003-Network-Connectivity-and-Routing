# Network Connectivity and Routing Optimization

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of network connectivity between multiple computers across two distinct networks using routers and switches. It includes the configuration of routing protocols and troubleshooting network connectivity issues using ping operations.

## Key Features
- Implemented network connectivity across two networks using routers and switches.
- Configured routing protocols to ensure optimized network traffic flow.
- Performed ping operations to verify connectivity and troubleshoot issues.
- Ensured seamless communication between different devices in the network.

## Technologies Used
- **Routers**: Configured to route traffic between different networks.
- **Switches**: Enabled multiple computers to connect and communicate within the network.
- **Routing Protocols**: Configured for efficient routing of data packets between networks.
- **Ping Operations**: Used to verify connectivity and troubleshoot network issues.

## Steps to Implement
1. **Network Design**: 
   - Set up two distinct networks with multiple computers.
   - Use switches for internal network connectivity.
   - Use routers to enable communication between the two networks.

2. **Router Configuration**:
   - Configure each router with appropriate IP addresses and routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF).
   - Ensure correct routing table entries for communication between networks.

3. **Switch Configuration**:
   - Connect multiple computers to the switch.
   - Ensure all devices are properly assigned IP addresses within their respective networks.

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Use `ping` commands to verify connectivity between computers in different networks.
   - Troubleshoot issues based on ping responses (latency, packet loss, etc.).

## Usage
- After configuring the network, run the `ping` command from one network to devices on the other network to verify connectivity:
    ```bash
    ping <destination IP>
    ```

## Troubleshooting
- If network connectivity fails, check:
  - Correct IP addressing and subnetting.
  - Router configuration for routing protocols and routes.
  - Physical connectivity between switches and routers.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementation of advanced routing protocols (BGP, EIGRP).
- Configuring network redundancy using HSRP or VRRP for router failover.
- Adding VLANs to segment the network for better security and traffic management.
